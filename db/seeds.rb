# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
Game.create([
                       { name: 'Empire Earth', location_url: 'http://localhost/empire-earth' },
                       { name: 'Smartbash', location_url: 'http://localhost/Smartbash' },
                     ]
